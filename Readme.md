# Perm, a program to generate permutations of its arguments.

Just do

```
make install clean
```

and It will be installed locally in your home directory
(using `$HOME/bin` and `$HOME/share/man/man1` to install
your local executable and the man page.

In case you want to modify any of these, look the `Makefile` for
options on setting `prefix`, `bindir` and `mandir` variables.

_Enjoy!!!_
